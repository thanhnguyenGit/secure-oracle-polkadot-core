# Orascript WASM Runner

This repository contains the **Orascript WASM Runner**, a core service for the secure oracle network built on the Polkadot ecosystem (specifically for `my-parachain`).

## Overview

The Orascript WASM Runner is designed to securely execute oracle scripts in a WebAssembly (WASM) environment. It serves as the execution layer for the decentralized oracle infrastructure on `my-parachain`, ensuring integrity, security, and performance.

## Features

- Secure execution of WASM-based oracle scripts (WIP)
- Orascript runtime for `my-parachain` (TS-alike)

## Getting Started

Coming soon...
